<h2>Smoked Chicken Hot Wings</h2>
 <p>These smoked hot wings are grilled until tender and delicious! Serve with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing.</p>
 
<h3>Indgredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>2 ½ pounds chicken wings</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) according to the manufacturer's directions.</li>
        <li>To make the dry rub: Mix 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning in a small bowl; sprinkle over chicken
            wings.</li>
        <li>Place chicken wings, unstacked, onto wire racks. Place the racks into the smoker. Add wood chips according to the
            manufacturer's directions; smoke chicken wings in the preheated smoker for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer smoked wings to a large bowl; stir
            in 1/2 of the sauce until wings are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Cook wings on the preheated grill until skin is browned and crispy, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a large bowl and stir in
            remaining sauce until wings are well coated.</li>
